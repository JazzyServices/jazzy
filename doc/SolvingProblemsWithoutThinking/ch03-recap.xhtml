<h1>Recap</h1>

<div class="normal">
    We have met the two most important techniques in puzzle-solving
    <ol>
        <li>Draw a map / make a model</li>
        <li>Eliminate the impossible</li>
    </ol>
    With these two techniques we can reduce many puzzles to a very simple
    path through a landscape.
    For example, we reduced the classic fox-goose-corn puzzle to moving
    along the edges of a cube. A puzzle that we said right at the start
    was so simple that it didn't really count as a puzzle.
    In the next chapter we will meet one more technique that reduces
    a puzzle to a simple mechanical process.
    Which begs the question, if a puzzle can be solved mechanically,
    is it really a puzzle? Since it doesn't involve any brain power.
