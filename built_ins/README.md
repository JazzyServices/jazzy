# Exploring Python's Built-in Functions

The files in this directory explore the Python
[built-in functions](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/functions.html);
providing a little more in-depth knowledge than is given in the Python documentation.
We have grouped the built-in functions into several areas,
each of which is discussed in a separate document:

- Strings and Representing Objects as Strings
   - [The `str()` built-in](strings.md)
   - [The `repr()` and `ascii()` built-ins](repr.md)
   - [The `hex()` built-in and friends](hexetc.md)
   - [The `print()` built-in](print.md)
   - [The `format()` built-in](format.md)
- Numbers
    - [The `int()` built-in](int.md)
    - [The `bool()` built-in](bool.md)
    - [The `float()` built-in](float.md)
    - The `complex()` built-in
    - [Built-in numerical functions](numbers.md)
- Iterables
    - [Iterable Types](iterables.md)
    - [Functions Processing Iterable Types](iterfuncs.md)
- [The `open()` built-in](files.md)
- [General objects and types](objects.md)
- [Attributes of objects](attributes.md)
- [Methods](methods.md)
- [Defining Types](defining.md)
- [Other Stuff](other.md)

## Warning
Python is a very powerful and flexible language
which means that there are many things that you can do in it.
However, with this power comes some responsibility.
> Just because you *can* do it,
> doesn't mean you *should* do it.

Some of the examples in this document contain some very funky, but legal,
Python syntax. The reader is warned *not to try this at ~~home~~ work*
